## Technology Used
This project started in HTML, SCSS/CSS and vanilla JavaScript (and a bit of PHP), but I ported it over to React for scaleability. Serverless backend functions managed by Netlify send emails from the contact page, and retrieve data from Contentful for information cards on my project page.
