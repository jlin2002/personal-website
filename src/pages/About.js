                I graduated from UNSW Sydney with a degree in Science (Mathematics) and Computer Science.
                In my spare time, I enjoy learning new technologies that allow me to express my creativity through software. 
                In particular, I am fascinated by the artistry of designing and creating minimalistic and beautiful user interfaces. 
                I also enjoy drawing and studying (human ðŸ‘©) languages, namely Chinese and Korean.
