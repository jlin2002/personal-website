                I'm a third year undergraduate Mathematics and Computer Science student at UNSW Sydney 
                where I also work as a casual academic tutoring COMP1511 Programming Fundamentals.
                In my spare time, I enjoy learning new technologies that allow me to express my creativity through software. 
                In particular, I am fascinated by the artistry of designing and creating minimalistic and beautiful user interfaces. 
                I also enjoy drawing and studying (human ðŸ‘©) languages, namely Chinese and Japanese.
